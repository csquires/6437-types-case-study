# 6437-types-case-study

This Jupyter notebook goes along with the April 19th, 2019 recitation for 6.437 (Inference and Information) at MIT,
which covered the Method of Types and Sanov's Theorem.

Feel free to use it in any way you wish, no credit is necessary. If you make improvements, I'd love to hear about them!
